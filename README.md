# Shanghainese-Potts-Romanisation
Shanghainese IME with Potts romanisation system

This IME requires RIME to work - this can be downloaded here https://rime.im/. I have written a guide to setting IMEs up on this reddit page (this is for setting up another IME, but the principles are the same): https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghainese/comments/hvr5xu/ime_for_shanghainese_available_here/. If you run into any problems, you can seek help in this Discord server: https://discord.gg/BFbnZvp.
